# Classification
This subfolder contains some of the code that I have done using Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest and others. As of now, I have only added the code done for my course in the master degree.

# Report
The nature of this algorithms is not to build the perfect one, but to be able to analyze effectively the outcomes of the various algorithms. The report showcases, in less than 1700 words, the analysis performed to the different algorithms. Critical thinking and analysis is at times more important than being able to use the libraries. Understanding the assumptions and pitfalls of the various algorithms is crucial to production-grade developments.

# Notice
Please make sure that if you use any part of the report that you abide by the University of Melbourne rules.

## Programming Language
All of this code is developed in Python.
