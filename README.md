# Machine Learning
This repo contains the development of various Machine Learning algorithms. It also hosts the code I've done towards the Coursera certification of Machine Learning. I try to use mostly Jupyter notebooks since it is the easiest way to visualize and play around with datasets.

## Getting Started
The folder structure is the following:

### Machine Learning Repo Folder Structure
    .
    ├── ML Foundations          # Code for the first Coursera course in the specialization
    ├── Regression              # Code for the first Coursera course in the specialization
    ├── Classification          # Code for my development of various classification algorithms
    ├── Clustering              # Code for my development of various clustering algorithms
    ├── Tutorials               # Code for tutorials I have followed along.
    └── README.md

## Programming Language
I try to use Python and will make it as clear as possible, maybe, I will try and replicate the results in R. I will keep a separate file where I'll try to put the libraries that I've used.
