# Recommendation Engine
This project is my attempt to create a Recommendation Engine in Python by using different means. I try to first use a basic approach using a small Memory Based Collaborative Fitlering approach. Then, I'll try to use a similar approach at scale (using the whole movielens set) and finally I will try to use tensorflow.

## Requirements
* Scikitlearn
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Tensorflow
* Jupyter notebooks
* [Movielens set](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
